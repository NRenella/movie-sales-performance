# Movie Sales Performance
## Purpose
I have a passion for data and movies, this project tackles the sales performance of tickets from 2020.

This project will be broken down into steps which can be seen below.

## Tools
I used Python, Tableau, Excel, and Kaggle for this project.

Python was used for data cleaning and formating.

The Movie Data can be found here: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/cinema-ticket/data)

Tableau was used for visualizing the data as seen above
